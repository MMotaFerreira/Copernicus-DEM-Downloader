# Copernicus DEM Downloader (AOI-based, Python)

A Python script to query and download **Copernicus DEM (GLO-30, DGED, COG)** tiles for a given **area of interest (AOI)** using the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem STAC API and authenticated S3 access.  
Supports **parallel downloads** (all cores minus one) for efficient bulk retrieval.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Works with **Copernicus DEM GLO-30 DGED COG** collection (30 m resolution, Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF).
- Uses **authenticated access** via S3 keys from your Copernicus Dataspace account.
- Supports **parallel downloads** for speed.
- Designed for reproducible scientific workflows in Python.
- Simple configuration at the top of the script (AOI path, layer name, output folder, and credentials).

## 🔑 Getting Credentials
To download Copernicus DEM tiles you need an account at [dataspace.copernicus.eu](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/):

1. Register for a free account [here](https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=cdse-public&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A//dataspace.copernicus.eu/account/confirmed/1).  
2. Generate an **Access Key** and **Secret Key** for S3 API access [here](https://eodata-s3keysmanager.dataspace.copernicus.eu/).  
3. Insert these keys in the script:
   ```python
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
   AWS_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"

Alternatively, you can set them as environment variables:

export CDSE_AWS_KEY=xxxx
export CDSE_AWS_SECRET=yyyy

⚙️ Dependencies

Install Python packages:

pip install boto3 pystac-client geopandas

You also need GDAL/fiona system libraries installed for geopandas.
▶️ Usage

    Place your AOI boundary in a GeoPackage (.gpkg) or Shapefile.

        The AOI layer name can be any (e.g. "AOI", "Border", "catchment").

        Update the layer_name variable in the script.

    Edit the script to set:

        gpkg_path → path to your AOI file

        layer_name → AOI layer name

        Ref → reference name for output folder

        out_base → folder where DEM tiles should be saved

        AWS_ACCESS_KEY / AWS_SECRET_KEY → Copernicus Dataspace credentials

    Run the script:

python CopDEM_Download.py

Downloaded DEM tiles will be stored in:

    <your_folder_path>/Copernicus-DEM/<Ref>/

📂 Output

    Raw DEM tiles (COG GeoTIFFs).

    Each file corresponds to one Copernicus DEM tile overlapping your AOI.

    You can mosaic and clip them using GDAL, rasterio, or terra in R.
